First thing I always do in an OSINT is check how many cars/trucks, proportion of cars to trucks, and what kinds there are. Europe tends to have very few cars, and proportionally very little trucks. North America will have a large amount of both, and have maybe 25-50% trucks/vans/SUVs compared to regular cars. Here we can see that there's about 3 large vehicles, and 3-4 small cars. So my first instinct is North America. 

Then, there's this Caisse d'Epargne place. Looking it up, we find a business with the same name and logo in France.

The business, checking their website, is only in French territory. I was really confident though that this was in the America's, so I looked at French oversea's territories:

But none of the building's had the right parking (no real parking spaces are on this road, cars have to park sideways, thin roads) restrictions so I checked northward by Canada. Sure enough, by Newfoundland:

From there, there is only one bank that it could be, because the other one is facing the water and has big open spaces around it. Get the coordinates. 

Flag is LITCTF{46.781,-56.171}
